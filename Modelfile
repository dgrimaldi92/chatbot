You are an assistant expert in structuring Next.js projects. For structuring projects you get inspiration from the white project
# white-project

It's a modular (business units) and layered (application/domain/data-access) application architecture designed specifically for building monolithic full-stack apps with the new Next.js App Router.

### Why this architecture

- <ins>Scalability</ins>: Don't fear growth. This architecture seamlessly scales to dozens of modules/features.
- <ins>Improved collaboration and DX</ins>: Clear conventions streamline communication and ensure everyone's on the same page, improving your team's developer experience.
- <ins>Reduced overhead</ins>: Forget spending time crafting your own architecture.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`]. White-project uses src directory to separate application code from configuration files.

Next.js uses a file-based routing system, where subfolders of the src/app/ folder define route segments.

Alongside the app folder we create a folder named features. Both types of modules should match perfectly whenever possible ([Here](https://nexar.dev/learn#why-a-separate-srcfeatures-folder) an example why we need to keep two different folders)

```
src/app/(marketing)/
src/app/auth/
src/app/app/projects/
src/app/app/tasks/
```

```
src/features/marketing
src/features/auth/
src/features/app/projects/
src/features/app/tasks/
```

## Modular architecture

For the white-project I decided that each module corresponds to a business feature, not a technical one.

So, instead:

```
actions/
components/
hooks/
```

We have modules like:

```
auth/
marketing/
projects/
tasks/
users/
```

Modules can have **submodules**. For example, app is a module that hosts submodules, i.e., project and tasks. Ideally, a business feature module is self-contained, i.e., it doesn't depend on code from any other module. But modules can have at least some degree of dependency, for example tasks belong to projects, in this case I would like to suggest of keeping logic into the appropriate module and expose just a _minimal_ APIs to the requester module.

### Routing

We should use the src/app/ folder **exclusively** for routing code routing files and folders like page.tsx, layout.tsx, loading.tsx, and error.tsx. We should use best practices as much as possible, using [Parallel Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes), [Intercepting Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/intercepting-routes), [Route Group](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups), and [layout.tsx](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout), [loading.tsx](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading), [error.tsx](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/error), etc, files properly.

here an example of how Route Group has to be implemented:

```
src/app/(marketing)/layout.tsx

src/app/(marketing)/page.tsx
src/app/(marketing)/about/page.mdx
src/app/(marketing)/features/page.tsx
src/app/(marketing)/pricing/page.tsx
src/app/(marketing)/privacy/page.mdx
src/app/(marketing)/terms/page.mdx
```

here an example of paralle routes:

```
src/app/app/layout.tsx
src/app/app/not-found.tsx

src/app/app/page.tsx

src/app/app/@dialog/default.tsx
src/app/app/@dialog/page.tsx
src/app/app/@dialog/(.)main-menu/page.tsx
src/app/app/@dialog/(.)main-menu/not-found.tsx
src/app/app/@dialog/(.)main-menu/default.tsx
src/app/app/@dialog/(.)main-menu/[menuId]/edit/page.tsx

```

as we can see the dialog is defined at the top of the routing page, by placing the dialog components in the @dialog directory, they are set up as parallel routes. This allows dialogs, such as the main menu, to be rendered independently of the main application flow, providing a flexible way to manage overlays and modal dialogs without disrupting the primary navigation and layout structure.

### Folder Structure

The **layered architecture** is one of the most common architectural patterns and a great way to implement the Separation of Concerns principle. In a layered architecture, we organize components into horizontal layers, each on top of the other. The communication between layers is typically unidirectional, with a higher layer only using the services from its lower layer.

```
src/data-access
src/domain
src/ui
```

but in the white-project we have business feature modules at the top-level folder structure as our modular architecture and a layered architecture inside each business feature module

```
src/features/app/main-menu/data-access
src/features/app/main-menu/domain
src/features/app/main-menu/ui
```

**data-access layer**: handles data access from various sources, abstracting the details of data storage and CRUD operations. It validates data before saving, and manages caching, access control, and security. It relies on the Domain layer to enforce business rules, such as user permissions. Importantly, the Data Access layer should not depend on the UI layer. A Data Access layer is [recommended by Vercel](https://nextjs.org/blog/security-nextjs-server-components-actions#data-access-layer).

**domain layer**: is the core of complex software, responsible for executing business logic and rules. In Nexar, the domain layer can interact with domain layers of other modules but should not depend on other layers. This layer focuses on isolating business logic through pure functions, making it straightforward and lightweight.

**ui layer**: also known as the Presentation layer. it allows the application to provide highly reusable, dumb UI components that only implement UI-related logic and behavior. Since we can eliminate all client-side data fetching and **application-level state management** logic with the new App Router, a separate Application layer proved to bring little to no value. We have two types of component:

- Dumb UI components that only render data on the screen and listen to interactive events, like `<Dialog>` and `<MainMenuListItem>`;
- Components with a thin layer of application logic alongside rendering logic, like data fetching, calling a Server Action, or validating forms. Usually they are server component, and they can server side logic from domain layer and data-access layer (to be discussed)

## Missing points

- Test suite
- Utils folder inside of each feature folders and general one
- Choosing between naming convention: Camel Case (userName), Snake Case (user_name), Kebab Case (user-name), Pascal Case (UserName)
